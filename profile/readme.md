# Welcome to Oak National Academy ðŸ‘‹

[Oak National Academy](https://www.thenational.academy/) was founded during the first UK lockdown in April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to support teachers and pupils with remote learning. We delivered over 150 million lessons to pupils across the UK during the 2020-2021 academic year.

In September 2022, Oak became an [arm's-length body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-bodies-reform#arms-length-bodies) of the UK Government. Oak is sponsored by the [UK Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) to which it is [stratgically aligned, but operationally independent.](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/oak-national-academy/about)

We are here to [support great teaching](https://www.thenational.academy/about-us/who-we-are), by supporting [teachers](https://www.thenational.academy/#teachers) and [pupils](https://www.thenational.academy/#pupils) with access to high-quality curriculum materials.

All of our [curriculum plans](https://www.thenational.academy/#curriculum) are aligned to the [National Curriculum in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum), carefully sequenced across year groups and designed by curriculum experts.

We're building fully resourced, openly licensed and [AI enabled curricula](https://www.thenational.academy/#ai) across 14 subjects across Key Stages 1-4.

## Our open-source projects

We also openly licence our code where it is possible to do so.

### Oak Web Application

Our main public-facing application is the open source [Oak Web Application](https://github.com/oaknational/Oak-Web-Application), built in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) and using the [Oak React components library](https://github.com/oaknational/oak-components).

## Our approach to our technical architecture

We take a serverless-first approach to hosting, with the majority of our applications and services running on dedicated PaaS and IaaS provider platforms. 

Our web applications are built and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), with a handful on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), while many of our supporting services are either outsourced or run on [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/?hl=en). 

We are in the process of moving all of our infrastructure management to [Terraform](https://github.com/oaknational/Cloud-Config).
